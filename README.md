I'm a seasoned web application developer with a proven track record of delivering high-impact solutions across the entire technology stack. My journey began building complex user interfaces and evolved into architecting enterprise-grade distributed systems that power critical business operations.

I specialize in .NET Core and C# development, with deep expertise in building scalable microservices using modern architectural patterns like Domain-Driven Design, CQRS, and Event Sourcing. I've successfully led teams, migrated legacy systems to modern platforms, and solved challenging performance problems for data-intensive applications serving Fortune 100 companies.

My technical toolkit spans the full spectrum: from crafting intuitive Angular interfaces to optimizing SQL Server stored procedures, from containerizing applications with Docker and Kubernetes to implementing robust CI/CD pipelines with Azure DevOps. I'm equally comfortable building serverless solutions with Azure Functions, setting up comprehensive monitoring with Application Insights and ELK stack, or diving deep into database optimization with Azure CosmosDB and SQL Server.

My commitment to excellence is backed by formal education from the University of Dhaka and industry-recognized Microsoft certifications: Azure Fundamentals, Azure Developer Associate, and Azure Administrator Associate. These credentials validate my expertise in designing, developing, and managing cloud-native solutions on the Azure platform.

What sets me apart is my ability to bridge the gap between complex technical challenges and business objectives. Whether I'm leading a team of 10 developers, migrating critical systems with zero downtime, or redesigning data models to meet evolving requirements, I focus on delivering measurable results that drive business value.

I thrive in fast-paced environments where I can make an immediate impact, mentor others, and continuously push the boundaries of what's possible with modern cloud technologies. If you're looking for someone who can architect, build, lead, and deliver—let's connect.
